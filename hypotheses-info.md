The *Hypothesis Testing* tool is used to verify the hypotheses of equality of mean/median values of a selected parameter for selected countries (2 or more). For 2 countries (A and B) the following hypothesis is verified:

$H_0:$ The mean/median values of the parameter are not significantly different between countries A and B ($H_A = M_B/M_A = M_B$).

Against one of the hypotheses:

$H_1:$ The mean/Median values of the parameter are significantly different between countries A and B ($Mu_A = M_B/M_A = M_B$; two-sided hypothesis).

$H_2:$ The mean/Median value of the parameter is greater in country A than in country B ($mu_A > \mu_B/M_A > M_B$; right-sided hypothesis).

$H_3:$ The mean/Median value of the parameter is smaller in country A than B ($Mu_A < M_B/M_A < M_B$; left-sided hypothesis).

If more than 2 countries are selected, the null hypothesis takes the form:

$H_0:$ Mean/Median values of the parameter do not differ between the analyzed countries ($M_A = M_B = M_B = M_k$).

In contrast, the alternative:

$H_A:$ Mean/Median values of the parameter differ between at least one pair of countries$i$ and $j$ ($mu_i = \mu_j/M_i = M_j$; two-sided hypothesis).
